# hamr-tool
A set of tools for speedy UI development wrapped around [PIXI](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) using dynamic Shape objects with filter modifiers. Also includes SVG parsing and automatic creation of near-identical Shape objects.

## Running tests
1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

### Continous test watcher
You'll need to run gulp for this. Use `gulp test-watch` to start the watcher task.

You might need gulp installed globally, in which case run `npm install -g gulp` first.
